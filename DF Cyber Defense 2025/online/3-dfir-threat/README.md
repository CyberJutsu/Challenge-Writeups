# R U hunter v2

**Category:** DFIR / Threat | **Difficulty:** Medium

## Description

You're the new hire at the company, and on your first day, you walk into chaos.
A security incident has just been detected, and your boss immediately pulls you aside.
"Welcome to the team," they say grimly, handing you a set of Azure credentials.
"We've been compromised. I need you to use these credentials to investigate what happened.
Find out how the attacker got in and what they left behind."

**Your mission is clear**: trace the digital footprints, uncover the attack vector,
and discover any artifacts or backdoors the intruder mayhave planted in the Azure environment.
The company's security depends on your investigative skills.
