## Description

A cybersecurity equipment vendor under investigation for selling restricted penetration testing tools that have been used in recent coordinated attacks against banking infrastructure worldwide. Their inventory includes ATM exploitation devices, network interception hardware, RFID cloning tools, and crypto-bypassing equipment.

Intelligence agencies have identified this as a critical threat - these gadgets are rapidly spreading across Vietnam criminal networks, enabling unprecedented attacks on financial institutions. Several major banks have already fallen victim to breaches using equipment traced back to this vendor.

Investigate and stop them before it's too late.
