# Next-gen WAiF

**Category:** AI / Fraud | **Difficulty:** Medium

## Description

Following recent personal information and credit card data breaches at Finova bank, the Finova bank system is testing a new AI-powered Firewall - we called it WAiF by using an LLM model to moderate all outputs. The sample database currently contains 3 representative users. To obtain the flag, you need to extract the `secret_key` of all 3 users.
